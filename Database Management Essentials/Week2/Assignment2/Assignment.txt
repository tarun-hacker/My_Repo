1. For event requests, list the event number, event date (eventrequest.dateheld), and count of the event plans.  Only include event requests in the result if the event request has more than one related event plan with a work date in December 2018.

select EventRequest.EventNo,DateHeld,count(*) from EventRequest,EventPlan where EventRequest.EventNo = EventPlan.EventNo and WordDate between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-31' group by EventRequest.EventNo having count(*) > 1;
+---------+------------+----------+
| EventNo | DateHeld   | count(*) |
+---------+------------+----------+
| E106    | 2018-12-12 |        2 |
+---------+------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

2. List the plan number, event number, work date, and activity of event plans meeting the following two conditions: (1) the work date is in December 2018 and (2) the event is held in the “Basketball arena”.  Your query must not use the facility number (“F101”) of the basketball arena in the WHERE clause. Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value of “Basketball arena”.

select distinct EventPlan.PlanNo,EventPlan.EventNo,EventPlan.WordDate,EventPlan.Activity from EventPlan,EventPlanLine,Location,Facility where EventPlan.PlanNo = EventPlanLine.PlanNo and EventPlanLine.LocNo = Location.LocNo and Location.FacNo = Facility.FacNo and EventPlan.WordDate between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-31' and Facility.FacName = 'Basketball arena';
+--------+---------+------------+-----------+
| PlanNo | EventNo | WordDate   | Activity  |
+--------+---------+------------+-----------+
| P101   | E104    | 2018-12-03 | Operation |
| P102   | E105    | 2018-12-05 | Operation |
| P103   | E106    | 2018-12-12 | Operation |
| P349   | E106    | 2018-12-12 | Setup     |
+--------+---------+------------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


3. List the event number, event date, status, and estimated cost of events where there is an event plan managed by Mary Manager and the event is held in the basketball arena in the period October 1 to December 31, 2018.  Your query must not use the facility number (“F101”) of the basketball arena or the employee number (“E101”) of “Mary Manager” in the WHERE clause. Thus, the WHERE clause should not have conditions involving the facility number or employee number compared to constant values.

select EventRequest.EventNo,EventRequest.DateHeld,EventRequest.Status,EventRequest.EstCost from EventRequest,EventPlan,Facility,Employee where EventRequest.EventNo = EventPlan.EventNo and EventRequest.FacNo = Facility.FacNo and EventPlan.EmpNo = Employee.EmpNo and Employee.EmpName = 'Mary Manager' and Facility.FacName = 'Basketball arena' and EventRequest.DateHeld between '2018-10-01' and '2018-12-31';
+---------+------------+----------+---------+
| EventNo | DateHeld   | Status   | EstCost |
+---------+------------+----------+---------+
| E106    | 2018-12-12 | Approved | 2000.00 |
+---------+------------+----------+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


4.

Your query must not use the facility number (“F101”) of the basketball arena in the WHERE clause. Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value of “Basketball arena”.


select EventPlanLine.PlanNo,EventPlanLine.LineNo,ResourceTbl.ResName,EventPlanLine.NumberFId,Location.LocName,EventPlanLine.TimeStart,EventPlanLine.TimeEnd from EventPlanLine,EventPlan,ResourceTbl,Location,Facility where
